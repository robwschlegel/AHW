abstract = {In austral summer 2011, an unprecedented Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o event occurred off the west coast of Australia, with sea surface temperature anomalies reaching 5. C and significant impacts on marine ecosystems. In this study, a high resolution ({\~{}}2. km) hydrodynamic model (Regional Ocean Modeling System) is used to simulate the variations in the near-surface temperature in the region from 2009 through mid-2011. Model results indicate that the peak temperatures in the broad mid-west coast of Australia during the event are predominantly due to poleward advection of warmer, tropical water (???2/3 contribution). In addition, positive air-sea heat flux into the ocean also contributes (???1/3 contribution) to the rise in temperature. The anomalous advection of warm water is caused by changes in the poleward flowing Leeuwin Current due to both local and remote wind forcing. In early 2011, the Leeuwin Current intensified owing to remote forcing by the equatorial easterly wind anomalies in the Pacific Ocean associated with the 2010-2011 La Ni{\~{n}}a. In addition, the southerly winds off the west coast of Australia weakened, allowing the Leeuwin Current to further intensify in speed at the peak of the event. Concurrently, the inshore, equatorward Capes Current was suppressed and reversed direction. The poleward flow over the shelf contributed to near-shore warming in contrast to cooling by upwelling and equatorward advection from the Capes Current in previous years.},

The procedure for calculation is based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The transfer coefficients are stability dependent. Some calculations are also performed utilizing several different datasets. One of these covers the region of Asian monsoon oceans during the Global Experiment. This is a daily sea surface temperature (SST) dataset. A second dataset covers the global oceans for the entire FGGE year. This is a 10-day averaged dataset prepared by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts. A third dataset obtained from the Japan Meteorological Agency, covers a 7-year period between 1979 and 1985. This dataset was also averaged over 10-day periods. Both the daily and the 10-day averaged SST data have been used for studies of low frequency oscillations. An equivalence, on the time scale of 30 to 50 days, for the oscillations of these two datasets is demonstrated. The global distribution of SST oscillations on this time scale are explored. The region of pronounced variance in the SST oscillation lies over the equatorial western Pacific Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. Calculations of air-sea energy fluxes include (i) the total contribution, (ii) those contributed on the time scale of 30 to 50 days, and (iii) those obtained by suppressing oscillations for one or more of the variables on this time scale. The main results of these computations show that SST oscillations with an amplitude of 0.3° to 1.0°C occur on this time scale over the tropical oceans.

abstract = {Late in summer 2003, extensive mass mortality of at least 25 rocky benthic macro-invertebrate species (mainly gorgonians and sponges) was observed in the entire Northwestern (NW) Mediterranean region, affecting several thousand kilometers of coastline. We were able to characterize the mortality event by studying six areas covering the main regions of the NW Mediterranean basin. The degree of impact on each study area was quantified at 49 sites by estimating the proportion of colonies affected in populations of several gorgonian species compared with reference data obtained in years without mortality signs. According to these data, the western areas (Catalan coast and Balearic Islands) were the least affected, while the central areas (Provence coast and Corsica-Sardinia) showed a moderate impact. The northernmost and eastern areas (Gulf of Genoa and Gulf of Naples) displayed the highest impact, with almost 80{\%} of gorgonian colonies affected. The heat wave of 2003 in Europe caused an anomalous warming of seawater, which reached the highest temperatures ever recorded in the studied regions, between 1 and 3 °C above the climatic values (mean and maximum). Because this exceptional warming was observed in the depth ranges most affected by the mortality, it seems likely that the 2003 anomalous temperature played a key role in the observed mortality event. A correlation analysis between temperature conditions and degree of impact seems to support this hypothesis. Under the present climate warming trend, new mass mortality events may occur in the near future, possibly driving a major biodiversity crisis in the Mediterranean Sea.},

abstract = {One of the major concerns with a potential change in climate is that an increase in extreme events will occur. Results of observational studies suggest that in many areas that have been analyzed, changes in total precipitation are amplified at the tails, and changes in some temperature extremes have been observed. Model output has been analyzed that shows changes in extreme events for future climates, such as increases in extreme high temperatures, decreases in extreme low temperatures, and increases in intense precipitation events. In addition, the societal infrastructure is becoming more sensitive to weather and climate extremes, which would be exacerbated by climate change. In wild plants and animals, climate-induced extinctions, distributional and phenological changes, and species' range shifts are being documented at an increasing rate. Several apparently gradual biological changes are linked to responses to extreme weather and climate events.},

abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

abstract = {Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6°C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

@article{Perkins2013,
abstract = {Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heat- related indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum tem- perature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951–2008 and 1971–2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951–2008 than for 1971–2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean mag- nitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves.},

Examples include SST fluctuations in the Southern Ocean associated with the Southern Annular Mode, a tripolar pattern of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, and a pan-Pacific mode known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (with additional contributions from oceanic processes). They may also result from coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the tropical Indo-Pacific, the tropical Atlantic Nino, and the cross-equatorial meridional modes ill the tropical Pacific and Atlantic. Finally, patterns of SST variability may arise from intrinsic oceanic modes, notably the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.},

Peak SST during a 2-week period were 5°C warmer than normal, causing widespread coral bleaching and fish kills. Understanding the climatic drivers of this extreme event, which we dub "Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o", is crucial for predicting similar events under the influence of global warming. Here we use observational data and numerical models to demonstrate that the extreme warming was mostly driven by an unseasonable surge of the poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current in austral summer, which transported anomalously warm water southward along the coast. The unusual intensification of the Leeuwin Current was forced remotely by oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections associated with the extraordinary 2010-2011 La Ni{\~{n}}a. The amplitude of the warming was boosted by both multi-decadal trends in the Pacific toward more La Ni{\~{n}}a-like conditions and intraseasonal variations in the Indian Ocean.},

abstract = {Starting from the assumption that the atmosphere is the primary source of variability internal to the midlatitude atmosphere-ocean system on intraseasonal to interannual timescales, the authors construct a simple stochastically forced, one-dimensional, linear, coupled energy balance model. The coupled system is then dissected into partially coupled and uncoupled systems in order to quantify the effects of coupling. The simplicity of the model allows for analytic evaluation of many quantities of interest, including power spectra, total variance, lag covariance between atmosphere and ocean, and surface flux spectra. The model predicts that coupling between the atmosphere and ocean in the midlatitudes will enhance the variance in both media and will decrease the energy flux between the atmosphere and the ocean. The model also demonstrates that specification of historical midlatitude sea surface temperature anomalies as a boundary condition for an atmospheric model will not generally lead to a correct simulation of low-frequency atmospheric thermal variance. This model provides a simple conceptual framework for understanding the basic aspects of midlatitude coupled variability. Given the simplicity of the model, it agrees well with numerical simulations using a two-level atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab mixed layer ocean. The simple model results are also qualitatively consistent with the results obtained in several other studies in which investigators coupled realistic atmospheric general circulation models to ocean models of varying complexity. This suggests that the experimental design of an atmospheric model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model would provide a reasonable null hypothesis against which to rest for the presence of distinctive decadal variability.},

@misc{Frankignoul1985,
abstract = {The mechanisms that contribute to the generation and damping of large-scale mid-latitude sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are discussed. The SST anomalies reflect primarily the response of the upper ocean to the changes in air-sea fluxes that are associated with daily weather fluctuations. Heat flux forcing is dominant in the lower middle latitudes, while wind-driven entrainment may be most effective in the high latitudes; advection by anomalous Ekman current is generally less important, and Ekman pumping is negligible. The SST anomalies decay in part because of entrainment effects associated with mixed-layer deepening and oceanic mixing and in part because of heat exchanges with the atmosphere. The three approaches commonly used to model the evolution of SST anomalies are reviewed: case studies based on monthly or seasonal anomaly maps of the large-scale SST and atmospheric anomalies, numerical simulations with one-dimensional mixed-layer models, and stochastic forcing models. We stress the similarities in the different approaches and discuss their main advantages and limitations. The response of the atmosphere to mid-latitude SST anomalies is considered. First, we discuss the poorly known relationship between SST anomalies and diabatic heating. Using a crude assumption for the air-sea coupling, we consider a two-layer quasi-geostrophic channel model and discuss the stationary wave response to SST anomaly forcing and the resulting air-sea feedback. It is found that the back interaction of the SST anomalies onto the atmosphere causes a weak SST anomaly damping at large scales and a strong one at small scales; the air-sea coupling should also act as an eastward propagator for the SST anomalies. The response of more realistic linear wave models to prescribed diabatic heating is then reviewed, and it is suggested that realistic mid-latitude SST anomalies have a weak influence on the atmospheric circulation, corresponding to changes in the geopotential height of 10–30 m at most. This order of magnitude is consistent with the results of general circulation model experiments and with the limited climate predictability associated with mid-latitude SST anomalies.},
