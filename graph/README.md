This folder contains files required to make maps as well as a custom ggplot2 theme. It also contains figures showing the synoptic air-sea state during each MHW analysed in this project.

The .Rdata files found in this folder tend to consist of what their name would imply.

The "synoptic" folder contains the synoptic atlas figures for each MHW.
